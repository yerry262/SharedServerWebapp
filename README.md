## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't access from network
- Verify server is running (check terminal output)
- Use IP address instead of hostname: `http://192.168.x.x:8008`
- Check Windows Firewall allows port 8008 (see Firewall Configuration section)
- Ensure all devices are on the same network
- Try disabling VPN if connected

### Upload fails
- Check available disk space on storage drive (E:\TankStorage)
- Verify folder write permissions
- Try smaller files first (under 100MB to test)
- Check server logs in terminal for specific errors
- Ensure path doesn't have permission restrictions

### Drag and drop not working
- Make sure you're dragging onto a folder (not a file)
- Folders highlight when you can drop
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser

### Videos won't play
- Check browser codec support (Chrome recommended)
- Try different browser
- Download and play locally if needed
- Check file isn't corrupted

### File tree not loading
- Check server is running
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify E:\TankStorage path exists and is accessible

### Files disappear after moving
- This was fixed - UI now auto-refreshes after moves
- If issue persists, click 🔄 refresh button
- Check the destination folder - file should be there
